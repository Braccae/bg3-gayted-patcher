> create a python script 'feat-patcher.py' that will read a 'Progressions.lsx' file as an xml. each node with the id 'Progression' will have a comment on the line above with a comment. for example <!-- ShadowMagic --> at line 192 and <!-- ArcaneArcher --> at line 78. When the script is run like 'feat-patcher.py -i /path/to/input-file.lsx -o /path/to/output-file.lsx -c class1 class2 class3 -l level1 level2 level3' store each class string seperated by a space as a variable under 'classes' and level under 'levels'.  
  'subclasses' matches node id Progression attribute id Name value like subClass in <attribute id="Name" type="LSString" value="subClass"/>  
  'levels' matches node id Progression attribute id Level value 'levels' like in<attribute id="Level" type="uint8" value="'levels'"/>  
  For every node id Progression that matches the 'subclasses' variable, parse the rest of the node to see if it matches the 'levels' variable. If the node matches both variables, check for an attribute with the id AllowImprovement like in <attribute id="AllowImprovement" type="bool" value="True"/>  
  if one is found, check the value and set it to true, if not found, create one like in line 259 of clean-Progressions.lsx  
  make sure the output file maintains any comments and unchanged data from the original.  
use: tree.write(output_file_path, xml_declaration=True, encoding='UTF-8') to preserve the declaration in the output file
